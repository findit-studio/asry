//! Alignment worker pool.
//!
//! Single worker (v1). The pool consumes `AlignWorkItem`s from a
//! bounded crossbeam channel, looks up the right `Aligner` in the
//! shared `Arc<AlignmentSet>`, runs the alignment pipeline, and
//! ships `AlignResultMsg` back to the runner via a separate result
//! channel.
//!
//! Mirrors `WhisperPool`'s shape with three differences:
//! 1. **Single worker** (no per-language parallel).
//! 2. **Drop-hang fix from the start** — `mem::replace`s `work_tx`
//! with a dummy disconnected channel before joining workers, so
//! the worker's blocking `recv()` returns immediately.
//! 3. **Cancellable watchdog** — the per-job watchdog uses
//! `recv_timeout` on a one-shot channel rather than
//! `thread::sleep`, so the worker can cancel it instantly when
//! inference completes.
