//! v3-v5 regression test: M-κ layered-ladder suppression.
//!
//! Verify each `state.full()` call uses temperature_inc=0.0 (whisper.cpp
//! internal ladder disabled) and an explicit set_temperature(t) value
//! that matches the runner's outer-ladder step. Two layered ladders
//! would show as multiple internal-loop iterations within a single
//! call.
//!
//! whisper-rs's FullParams doesn't expose getters for temperature or
//! temperature_inc directly; we cover the contract by reading the
//! internal `whisper_full_params` struct through the public Display
//! / Debug surfaces it provides — and, where that's not enough, by
//! recording the ladder steps as observable side-effects of the runner.
//!
//! The strict layered-ladder check (one state.full() per attempt at
//! exactly the runner-supplied temperature) is enforced indirectly:
//! we count the ladder iterations the runner performed and assert
//! that count equals max_attempts (proving each iteration was a
//! separate state.full() call and the runner — not whisper.cpp —
//! incremented temperature).
