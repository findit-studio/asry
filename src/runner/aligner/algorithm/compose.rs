    // `hop_samples` (e.g. 320 for wav2vec2-base) while
    // `compose_words` used the WhisperX effective ratio
    // `n_samples / (T - 1)`. On a 30 s chunk where wav2vec2
    // truncates one frame at the edge (T=1499 for n_samples=
    // 480000), the per-frame stride drift is ~0.43 samples,
    // accumulating to ~644 samples (40 ms) by the last frame.
    // That asymmetry can:
    //
    // - Misclassify a late-chunk frame as speech (because the
    // nominal interval lands inside a VAD segment) while
    // `compose_words` emits the word at samples that are
    // actually outside the VAD speech span (kept word with
    // misaligned timing).

    // - Or symmetrically: drop a valid late-frame word
    // because the nominal frame interval lands outside a VAD
    // segment that the effective-ratio interval would have
    // matched.
    //
    // The fix is to feed both functions the same
    // `samples_per_frame` value. This regression pins that
