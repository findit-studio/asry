//! Non-ignored regression for codex finding [high]: the upstream
//! `wav2vec2-base-960h/tokenizer.json` ships in an older HF format
//! that `tokenizers 0.20` rejects with `ModelUntagged`. `build.rs`
//! patches the fetched JSON to inject the `model.type` discriminator
//! so `Aligner::from_paths` can actually load it.
//!
//! This test is the direct counterpart to that build.rs path: when
//! the fixture is present (the `alignment` feature is on AND
//! `WHISPERY_OFFLINE` is unset), it asserts that `Aligner::from_paths`
//! returns `Ok` against the fetched + patched files. Without this
//! test the patch could silently regress and only `alignment_e2e`
//! (currently `#[ignore]`'d for unrelated drain-hang reasons) would
//! catch it.
