//! Sans-I/O types for resolving out-of-vocab characters
//! during wav2vec2 alignment tokenization.
//!
//! ## Where these flow
//!
//! Whispery's alignment dispatcher is Sans-I/O: the library
//! never owns ASR / alignment workers, never calls back into
//! caller code, and never blocks on user policy. Per-chunk
//! OOV policy is supplied alongside the alignment work item
//! itself, not via a separate command/response round-trip:
//!
//! ```text
//! AlignmentSet::detect_oov(text, lang) -> Vec<OovEvent>
//! └─ caller pairs each event with a decision via a helper
//! from this module (or its own loop) producing a per-
//! chunk Vec<ResolvedOov>
//!
//! AlignWorkItem { runs, oov_decisions: Vec<Vec<ResolvedOov>>, .. }
//! └─ alignment pool reads `oov_decisions[run_idx]` for each
//! run and threads it into `tokenize_with_word_map`; the
//! dispatcher recomputes events for the chunk's text and
//! refuses to apply a payload whose events do not match
//! by identity (kind / char_index / word_index / language).
//! Length, outer-shape, OR per-position identity mismatch
//! fails loudly as
//! `::TokenizationFailed` instead of
//! silently mis-aligning a stale-but-same-length payload.
//! ```
//!
//! For whole-chunk alignment use [`AlignmentSet::detect_oov`]
//! and supply a single inner `Vec<ResolvedOov>`. For per-run
//! alignment use [`AlignmentSet::detect_oov_per_run`] and
//! supply one inner vec per run.
//!
//! [`AlignmentSet::detect_oov`]: crate::runner::aligner::AlignmentSet::detect_oov
//! [`AlignmentSet::detect_oov_per_run`]: crate::runner::aligner::AlignmentSet::detect_oov_per_run
//!
//! ## Why the caller decides
//!
//! WhisperX wildcards every OOV char (matches `*` placeholder
//! 1:1). That produces continuous alignment but plausible-but-
//! wrong word ranges on pronounced symbols (`&` in `AT&T` is
//! pronounced as the word "and"; aligning it to whichever vocab
//! item wins the frame yields confidently-wrong timing).
//! Whispery's earlier defaults baked the policy into the
//! tokenizer (`whisperx-strict-tokenizer` Cargo feature
//! flipped between fail-closed and wildcard-all) — that
//! denied the caller per-language / per-deployment / per-call
//! choice.
//!
//! Surfacing OOV as data passes the policy decision back to the
//! caller: the library detects OOV chars and returns them as
//! events; the caller applies whatever policy fits their
//! workflow (fail-closed, wildcard-all, fail on `&` but
//! wildcard digits, consult an ops dashboard, etc.). The
//! default policy lives in caller-side helper functions in
//! this module, not inside the library's hot path.
